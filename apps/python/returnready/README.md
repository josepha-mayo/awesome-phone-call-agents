# ReturnReady

**A phone answer is not a shipping label.**

A local return-enquiry workbench for comparing five spoken return details with the supplied written instructions: authorization, destination, shipping payer, deadline and refund/replacement terms. It prepares a bounded CALL-E request and carries transcript-linked questions into a human handoff.

## Working revision, explicit provider gate

The current 0.4 candidate adds an operator-mediated importer for finished CALL-E MCP results. A real authorized US hotline attempt connected on September 9 for 36 seconds, but permission for the recorded/transcribed enquiry was not granted and no return details were obtained. This is a recorded negative-path attempt, not a successful merchant test. Selected real outcome metadata was processed by the local engine; the browser demonstration uses redacted metadata and publishes no call transcript or recording. Nigeria remains restricted according to support. The separate REST adapter is still not live-verified.

The source here was recovered from the original September 7 v0.1 `ReturnReady-prototype.zip`. A later v0.2 description existed, but its source could not be located. This candidate reimplements and tests the described later-correction and persistence changes against the actual recovered source. It does not count the reported 96 v0.2 tests as inherited. `docs/PROTOTYPE-README.md` preserves the recovered prototype documentation; prior execution records remain in the pinned source history. The small `evidence03/` records document the no-call candidate checks.

## Run without calls

Python 3.11 or later, no runtime dependencies:

```sh
python returnready.py
# Open http://127.0.0.1:8765
```

Default mode cannot start a call, even if a process happens to contain a provider key. Four examples are explicitly synthetic. The initial changed-address case returns four supported wording matches. The all-matching example still permits only **human review**, never shipping clearance. The caller-echo case returns zero supported recipient matches.

The new **later correction** example first supplies five matching answers, then changes the return address in a later recipient turn. The comparison drops the address match and displays the entire later quotation. It does not discard later transcript context just because an earlier extraction matched. A same-turn revision or unscoped correction is also flagged conservatively. This is lexical triage, not general semantic contradiction detection; benign phrases can be flagged and unrecognized revisions can be missed.

## Finish the operator's handoff

The clarification text includes the supplied written value, extracted phone value, reason and relevant later quotation. Full transcript turns remain inspectable. Source edits immediately disable prior exports; asynchronous responses cannot overwrite more recent input changes.

**Save review inputs** downloads a separate input session. Reopen it to restore the written instructions and original result, then recompute correction and freshness checks at the current time. Saved approvals are ignored. An old observation is not refreshed by reopening, and a corrupted file leaves the current review intact. Fingerprints check bytes, not authenticity or identity. Whoever owns the input can edit it and compute a new fingerprint.

Only a single recipient and single call attempt are supported; multiple attempts require manual reconciliation. A quoted value must actually occur in its cited recipient (`speaker: user`) turn. Caller text, a generated summary and a confidence score are not recipient evidence. The whole cited turn is checked for qualifications; the cited and later recipient turns are checked for possible revisions. All supplied policy values need source labels. Different wording remains a question to resolve, not a legal ruling.

## Provider route: prepare, authorize, run once, resume

The REST adapter uses the published `/v1/calls` and `/v1/calls/{id}` routes with server-only credentials and an idempotency key. It uses one recipient, the actual country/locale/timezone, a result schema and a narrowly delimited task. It has been tested with injected and loopback HTTP providers, **not the authenticated CALL-E service**.

To run an approved call from a trusted local computer, set `CALLE_API_KEY` in that server's environment and explicitly launch:

```sh
python returnready.py --live
```

Do not put a key in a chat message, URL, browser field, repository or recorded demo. The provider dashboard and official client own authentication. Specify the actual recipient and a current consent basis. Review the no-call preview and type its exact recipient confirmation before starting. Calling is limited to the supplied recipient timezone's 09:00–18:00 window. The app never relaxes that limit to obtain a demo.

The database claims an intent before a provider request. The same request reuses its case; an ambiguous start cannot be retried automatically. If a call ID is known, poll or reopen the existing case instead of dialing again. A first terminal response and its observation time are retained even under concurrent polling. A later poll cannot refresh stale evidence or overwrite the stored terminal outcome. SQLite connections close after every transaction.

Only an **unstarted preview** can be cancelled in this app. Active calls require the provider's supported controls; no local cancellation button claims to stop them. The task permits only an enquiry, not a purchase, refund, fee acceptance, courier booking or shipment authorization. Declines and voicemail do not authorize broader action.

See `docs/LIVE-TEST-HANDOFF.md` for the blocked live-test checklist. The interface can help prepare a call, but no test may be labelled live until an actual provider result exists.

## Finished MCP result import

Use the existing Inspect the data view, open Import a finished CALL-E MCP result, and supply the expected run ID, original observation time and an explicit permission review. Unknown or unavailable permission produces a metadata-only hold. No transcript or extracted claims are saved, and no call or retry is made. Even on a permitted result, return fields must be separately quoted and source-indexed; no answer is invented from a success flag. `docs/MCP-RESULT-IMPORT.md` documents the narrow observed format, CLI and limitations. The result is operator-supplied, not independently authenticated.

## Reproduce the candidate checks

```sh
python -m unittest test_returnready http_test test_completion test_mcp_import -v
# Real HTTP/Chromium run (requires Playwright + Chromium):
python browser_completion.py
# Explicit isolated bridge fallback, never equivalent to the HTTP run:
python browser_completion.py --isolated
```

The 68 recovered tests and 24 new unit/HTTP/concurrency checks passed. All 18 new UI workflows also passed against the real Python HTTP server with the default security policy in GitHub Actions run 34297647083. This is separate from the earlier local bridge run, where direct local navigation was blocked. The historical `evidence03/release.json` records the candidate gate before this upstream contribution. `evidence03/upstream-verification.json` records revalidation on the upstream base. The old v0.1 browser files are intentionally not included as current regressions.

There is no third-party runtime service in the default mode. For the browser checks, install `playwright==1.55.0` and run `python -m playwright install chromium`. Browser tests also accept `CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE`. The actual HTTP test is authoritative; `--isolated` is an explicitly labelled fallback, not an HTTP verification. Standard-library transport tests exercise the real HTTP adapter against loopback servers, and negative cases prevent credential forwarding through redirects. The code and demo are not a security certification or customer-benefit study.

## Contribution scope and live-service status

This is a runnable application contribution under `apps/python/returnready/`, not proof of a completed competition entry. The connected MCP negative-path attempt and the result importer are distinct from the unverified REST adapter. Successful authorized return-information testing, confirmation of the CALL-E account email, public video hosting and final submission remain open. A synthetic review example is never a live merchant conversation.

## Provenance, privacy and limits

Original implementation and this candidate were developed with substantial AI assistance; original code is MIT licensed. No real customer or merchant data is included in examples. The explicit source comparisons are not proof of merchant identity, written-policy truth, consent, entitlement or safe shipment. Deadline checks accept only an absolute date and do not infer legal cutoffs. The observation timestamp is user-held and not independently authenticated.

The app is a one-operator loopback service, not an internet-exposed multi-tenant system. Default examples make no provider request. A live CALL-E call would necessarily share the approved minimum enquiry facts with that provider and recipient; minimize data before authorizing it.
