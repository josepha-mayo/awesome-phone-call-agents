"""Filters a jurisdiction's generic compliance checks down to the ones
actually applicable to a given use case.

compliance/dispatcher.py and compliance/jurisdictions/*.py stay
purpose-agnostic: they produce the full set of checks for a phone
number regardless of why the call is being made. This module is the
one place that knows which of those checks are about commercial
solicitation specifically - and therefore do not apply to a
non-solicitation use case - versus generically applicable regardless
of purpose (AI-disclosure, revocation, a documented legal basis for
processing personal data).

Sourced from the multi-jurisdiction legal research: the calling-window
statutes (47 CFR 64.1200(c)(1), Oregon HB 3865), the prior-express-consent
requirements (US PEWC, EU/FR opt-in), the DNC/opposition-list scrubs, and
Oregon's solicitation-frequency cap are each scoped in their own text to
"telephone solicitation" / "telemarketing" / "demarchage telephonique" -
not to calls in general. A non-commercial call this app makes (resolving
a genuine factual uncertainty, at the recipient's own request or in their
own interest) falls outside that scope. AI-disclosure and revocation are
not scoped to solicitation in their source statutes and stay applicable
regardless of use case - see README's "Compliance by use case" section
for the full reasoning and its honest limits.

Adding a second use case means adding one entry to
_EXEMPT_SUFFIXES_BY_USE_CASE, not building a jurisdiction x use case
matrix.
