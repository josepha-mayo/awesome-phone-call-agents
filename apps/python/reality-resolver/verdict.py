"""Reconciliation from CALL-E's structured_result to a case verdict.

Also defines subject_intent_result_schema(), the result_schema sent to
CALL-E for a Reality Resolver call. Every field description in that
schema is deliberately domain-neutral: it is the text CALL-E's own
extraction model reads, so naming one use case's vocabulary there
would quietly bias extraction on every other use case. The domain
belongs in the case file's call_task_hint, not in this schema.
